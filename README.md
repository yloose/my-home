# My Home

My-Home is a Android App build with Ionic/React and acts as a frontend for the WLED project from Aircookie,
which runs on the ESP chip and can control WS2812b LEDs (https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED).
Currently only working WLED project support for other devices will be added overtime.

2. Navigate into the direcoty and run
`ionic capacitor run android` or
`ionic capacitor run ios` for Ios (will only work on macOS)
3. Android Studio or Xcode will open and you have build the project as .apk or .ipa
